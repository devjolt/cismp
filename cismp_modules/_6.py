countermeasures to web-activity hacking
user training
acceptable use policy
access controlls
authentication
enmcryption
pen testing


malware countermeasures
user training and awareness
content scanning
checking software
firewall
sheep dip software
networ intrusion detection systenms / intrusion prevention system (NIDS/NIPS)


what is checking software vs sheep dip


system logs

event logs - on an ms system these cover all aspects of the systems but the most important logs are
security logs
system lohs
application log
access logs

audit logs - log user/machine activity such as logons, object access and special privilege actions

SIEM vs UTM
SIEM is a detective control
unified thread managements is a control but also 


hardenning is conducted at OS, system, network and application level

all systems should have unnecessary systems removed


a security posture is the level at which an organisation canwithstand an attack
baselines should be taken of all it systems after hardeiung
continues  monitoring always on

assessment tools

pair

protocol analyser/sniffer - wireshark
vulnerability scanners - nessus
ids/honeypots/honeynets
port scanners

VIPD is identifying vulnerabilities
pen-testing is exploiting vulnerabilities

wireshark, nesus, nmap, snort
zenmap is a gui version

when carrying out security assessments it is important to consider the following
baseline - current implemtnation
code reviews - glaws in program code
physical architecture - physical security
attack surface - visible to outside workd
deisgn reviews - of secuiry implemtnatin

When carrying out security testing, PLACEHOLDER is considered. What is the meaning of PLACEHOLDER in this context?
What is the word used to describe

types of testing
black box testing - no knowledge external and internal testing
grey box testing - partial knowledge of the target, login and password for one user, 
white box testing - full knowledge, network diagram, full access

what type of penetration testing would give you the best idea of your security posture?
black box
